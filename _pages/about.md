I am a psychiatry resident at Stanford University with a background in biostatistics and global health. 

My research focuses on statistical methods for causal inference, with an emphasis on optimal transport and graph-based testing. Before medicine, I completed a PhD in Biostatistics at Harvard, where I developed novel tools for analyzing multivariate data. I also hold an MD from UCLA, as well as a Master of Science in Global Health and Population from Harvard. My work has been published in leading journals across medicine and statistics and I have developed several statistical packages for data analysis. For more info, see the pages linked in the tabs above. 

Currently, I am a reviewer for the journal "Trials" and have served as a reviewer for the "Harvard Public Health Review."

Beyond research, I co-founded [TraumaLink](https://www.traumalink.net/), an emergency response system in Bangladesh, for which I helped secure a USAID grant of over $150,000, and have been involved in projects spanning global health, data science, and policy. I also enjoy teaching and have mentored several students in biostatistics and data science.
