	abstract = {Inflammasomes are cytosolic multiprotein complexes that sense microbial infection and trigger cytokine production and cell death. However, the molecular components of inflammasomes and what they sense remain poorly defined. Here we demonstrate that 35 amino acids of the carboxyl terminus of flagellin triggered inflammasome activation in the absence of bacterial contaminants or secretion systems. To further elucidate the host flagellin-sensing pathway, we generated mice deficient in the intracellular sensor Naip5. These mice failed to activate the inflammasome in response to the 35 amino acids of flagellin or in response to Legionella pneumophila infection. Our data clarify the molecular basis for the cytosolic response to flagellin.},

	volume = {79},
	issn = {00199567},
	doi = {10.1128/IAI.01187-10},
	abstract = {Inflammasomes are cytosolic multiprotein complexes that assemble in response to infectious or noxious stimuli and activate the {CASPASE}-1 protease. The inflammasome containing the nucleotide binding domainleucine-rich repeat ({NBD}-{LRR}) protein {NLRC}4 (interleukin-converting enzyme protease-activating factor [{IPAF}]) responds to the cytosolic presence of bacterial proteins such as flagellin or the inner rod component of bacterial type {III} secretion systems (e.g., Salmonella {PrgJ}). In some instances, such as infection with Legionella pneumophila, the activation of the {NLRC}4 inflammasome requires the presence of a second {NBDLRR} protein, {NAIP}5. {NAIP}5 also is required for {NLRC}4 activation by the minimal C-terminal flagellin peptide, which is sufficient to activate {NLRC}4. However, {NLRC}4 activation is not always dependent upon {NAIP}5. In this report, we define the molecular requirements for {NAIP}5 in the activation of the {NLRC}4 inflammasome. We demonstrate that the N terminus of flagellin can relieve the requirement for {NAIP}5 during the activation of the {NLRC}4 inflammasome. We also demonstrate that {NLRC}4 responds to the Salmonella protein {PrgJ} independently of {NAIP}5. Our results indicate that {NAIP}5 regulates the apparent specificity of the {NLRC}4 inflammasome for distinct bacterial ligands. Â© 2011, American Society for Microbiology.},
