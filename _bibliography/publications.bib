	abstract = {Inflammasomes are cytosolic multiprotein complexes that sense microbial infection and trigger cytokine production and cell death. However, the molecular components of inflammasomes and what they sense remain poorly defined. Here we demonstrate that 35 amino acids of the carboxyl terminus of flagellin triggered inflammasome activation in the absence of bacterial contaminants or secretion systems. To further elucidate the host flagellin-sensing pathway, we generated mice deficient in the intracellular sensor Naip5. These mice failed to activate the inflammasome in response to the 35 amino acids of flagellin or in response to Legionella pneumophila infection. Our data clarify the molecular basis for the cytosolic response to flagellin.},

	volume = {79},

	doi = {10.1128/IAI.01187-10},
	abstract = {Inflammasomes are cytosolic multiprotein complexes that assemble in response to infectious or noxious stimuli and activate the {CASPASE}-1 protease. The inflammasome containing the nucleotide binding domainleucine-rich repeat ({NBD}-{LRR}) protein {NLRC}4 (interleukin-converting enzyme protease-activating factor [{IPAF}]) responds to the cytosolic presence of bacterial proteins such as flagellin or the inner rod component of bacterial type {III} secretion systems (e.g., Salmonella {PrgJ}). In some instances, such as infection with Legionella pneumophila, the activation of the {NLRC}4 inflammasome requires the presence of a second {NBDLRR} protein, {NAIP}5. {NAIP}5 also is required for {NLRC}4 activation by the minimal C-terminal flagellin peptide, which is sufficient to activate {NLRC}4. However, {NLRC}4 activation is not always dependent upon {NAIP}5. In this report, we define the molecular requirements for {NAIP}5 in the activation of the {NLRC}4 inflammasome. We demonstrate that the N terminus of flagellin can relieve the requirement for {NAIP}5 during the activation of the {NLRC}4 inflammasome. We also demonstrate that {NLRC}4 responds to the Salmonella protein {PrgJ} independently of {NAIP}5. Our results indicate that {NAIP}5 regulates the apparent specificity of the {NLRC}4 inflammasome for distinct bacterial ligands. Â© 2011, American Society for Microbiology.},

	url = {https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2019/onlineprogram/AbstractDetails.cfm?abstractid=305236},
	abstract = {In the current computing age, models can often have hundreds or even thousands of parameters. With these large models comes the risk of losing the ability to communicate and understand the precise meaning of the individual parameters in a model. In a frequentist setting, one can use an L1 penalty to reduce the number of parameters in a model but similar methods have not been developed for Bayesian settings where the quantity of interest involves an integral over the posterior distribution. We introduce a new method using a penalized 2-Wasserstein distance to reduce the dimensionality of the parameter space while still obtaining a distribution over the remaining dimensions. Our method allows users to select a budget on how many parameters they wish to understand, interpret, and communicate to an audience, and, in a data dependent way, select a reduced posterior of the selected dimension that minimizes the distance to the full posterior. We provide simulation results comparing performance to other posterior summary methods and apply the method to cancer and environmental health data.},

	abstract = {In the current computing age, models can have hundreds or even thousands of parameters; however, such large models decrease the ability to interpret and communicate individual parameters. Reducing the dimensionality of the parameter space in the estimation phase is a commonly used technique, but less work has focused on selecting subsets of the parameters to focus on for interpretation--especially in settings such as Bayesian inference or bootstrapped frequentist inference that consider a distribution of estimates. Moreover, many models are not themselves easily interpretable and create another layer of obfuscation. To solve this gap, we introduce a new method that uses the Wasserstein distance to generate a low-dimensional interpretable model. After estimation of the main model, users can budget how many parameters they wish to interpret and our method will estimate an interpretable model of the desired dimension that minimizes the distance to the full model. We provide simulation results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method and apply the method to cancer data.},
