I have recently been working with the `rqPen` package in R In order to do some penalized median regression ($$L_1$$ regression with a group lasso penalty) and have found a bug in the group lasso code.

As it is right now, if someone is trying to fit a quantile regression using the SCAD or MCP penalties, the function is not passing the $$\gamma$$ tuning parameter (variable a in the code) to the solver.

I've filed an issue with the maintainer. Just wanted to flag this in case anyone is working with the `rqPen` package currently! Will update when/if I hear back.

**Update!:** I also noticed a bug when using the `rq.group.fit` function and trying to do a lasso penalty: it doesn't appear to be actually doing a group penalty, just a regular lasso. I have filed another bug request.

**Update (4/9/2020):** I heard back from the maintainer and he has submitted an update to CRAN regarding the error for the SCAD/MCP penalties. For the group lasso, he says this is by design(!) that it doesn't offer a group penalty, and is noted in the package help files. I misunderstood this to mean it was using some fancy linear programming method with the $$L_1$$ penalty to enforce group sparsity; this belief was incorrect!
